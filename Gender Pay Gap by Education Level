# The data I am using is a dataset of workers and their gender, job title, age, 
# education level, seniority, base pay, bonus. In this project I will be analyzing 
# if the gender pay gap exists based on differnt factors.
# I found the dataset on https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/nilimajauhari/glassdoor-analyze-gender-pay-gap

#loading the ggplot2 and plotly libraries 
library(ggplot2)
library(plotly)

#creating a variable to hold the information of the dataset I'm using
mydata <- read.csv("GenderPayGap.csv")

#changing the order of the levels for the Eduacation variable
#I did this in order to have the facets show up in order of how schooling works insetad of alphabetically
#The order of the levels is "High School", then "College", then "Masters", and finally "PhD".
mydata$Education <- factor(mydata$Education, levels = c("High School", "College", "Masters", "PhD"))


#Creating the plot variable
#I began by setting the x and y values and then grouping and coloring by Gender
#I created a scatterplot with the shape of the dot being based on Gender
#The first geom_smooth creates a black outline for the colored regression lines
#The second geom_smooth creates the colored regression lines
#I created facets based on Education
#I created my own color scheme using scale_color_manual()
